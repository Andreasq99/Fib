## Description <a name="description"></a>
A repository holding different attempts by my friend Nikhil and me at writing Fibonacci algorithms. As math graduate students, we're exploring ways of using coding to compute things we're interested in. This is our playground for doing that!

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To install, just clone the repository and make sure you have Python installed and added to your Path variables.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To run any program, open your favorite terminal, navigate to the repository, and run 

    python run.py [index of program file] [highest Fibonacci number to calculate]

For example, if I want to use the program in fib0.py to calculate the first thirty Fibonacci numbers, I would run

    python run.py 0 30

 The terminal will then spit out the first 30 Fibonacci numbers, and the time it took to calculate them. It's as simple as that!
